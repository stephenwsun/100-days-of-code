# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to create a personal finance app. I'm using React, Node.js, and Plaid for bank data.

**Thoughts**: I made good progress today. I went through Plaid's documentation and created a working example using their APIs and API keys.

### Day 2: April 20, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I created a hobby PostgreSQL database on Heroku and added Knex for building SQL queries.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have as much time today, but I was still able to make some progress on my app. Progress is progress.

### Day 3: April 21, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to use Ant Design's UI library for my personal finance app. The library has many components and the docs are great for React.
I also got Plaid's transaction api working, and I'll be looking to integrate this api once I have some more UI created.

**Thoughts**: I was able to fix the transactions api and create a plan for the frontend. Will look to expand on this tomorrow.

### Day 4: April 21, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I experimented with Kubernetes today, creating persistent volumes and spinning up pods in a cluster.

**Thoughts**: I wanted to see why Kubernetes was gaining so much traction in the market, and spent today playing around with different aspects of the technology. It was fun, and a nice break from working on my budgeting app.

### Day 5: April 26, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on my budgeting app, doing mostly frontend work in React. I integrated the transactions api and playing around with React Hooks.

**Thoughts**: Even though I missed a few days, I don't see it as a setback. The past few days at work were pretty hectic, so it was good that I'm able to recharge and hop right back in today.

### Day 6: April 28, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent today creating SQL tables, models, and routes in Node.js.

**Thoughts**: I've decided to work on 100 days of code earlier in the morning before my work day starts. I've found that by the end of day, I'm either too tired or have other side projects I need to work on.

### Day 7: April 29, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating Docker images and creating CI/CD pipelines for my React and Node.js apps.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit with copying files in my scripts and had to do some reading on how Docker handles context. I eventually got it working.

### Day 8: May 1, 2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working more in Node.js and Sequelize ORM today. Focused on database seeding and also writing unit tests with Jest.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a good start to the day. I usually try to get my 100 days of coding done before work but ran into internet and IDE issues.
