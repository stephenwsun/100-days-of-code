# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2020 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to create a personal finance app. I'm using React, Node.js, and Plaid for bank data.

**Thoughts**: I made good progress today. I went through Plaid's documentation and created a working example using their APIs and API keys.

### Day 2: April 20, 2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: I created a hobby PostgreSQL database on Heroku and added Knex for building SQL queries.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have as much time today, but I was still able to make some progress on my app. Progress is progress.

### Day 3: April 21, 2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to use Ant Design's UI library for my personal finance app. The library has many components and the docs are great for React.
I also got Plaid's transaction api working, and I'll be looking to integrate this api once I have some more UI created.

**Thoughts**: I was able to fix the transactions api and create a plan for the frontend. Will look to expand on this tomorrow.
